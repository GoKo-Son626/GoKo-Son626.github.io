The rest of this chapter explains the page tables that the RISC-V hardware provides and how xv6 uses them.</li></ul><h3 id="3-1-Paging-hardware"><a href="#3-1-Paging-hardware" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Paging hardware"></a>3.1 Paging hardware</h3><ul><li>As a reminder, RISC-V instructions (both user and kernel) manipulate virtual addresses. The machine’s RAM, or physical memory, is indexed with physical addresses. The RISC-V page table hardware connects these two kinds of addresses, by mapping each virtual address to a physical address.</li><li>Xv6 runs on Sv39 RISC-V, which means that only the bottom 39 bits of a 64-bit virtual address are used; the top 25 bits are not used. In this Sv39 configuration, a RISC-V page table is logically an array of 227 (134,217,728) page table entries (PTEs). Each PTE contains a 44-bit physical page number (PPN) and some flags. The paging hardware translates a virtual address by using the top 27 bits of the 39 bits to index into the page table to find a PTE, and making a 56-bit physical address whose top 44 bits come from the PPN in the PTE and whose bottom 12 bits are copied from the original virtual address. Figure 3.1 shows this process with a logical view of the page table as a simple array of PTEs (see Figure 3.2 for a fuller story). A page table gives the operating system control over virtual-to-physical address translations at the granularity of aligned chunks of 4096 (212 ) bytes. Such a chunk is called a page.<br><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch3/image.png" alt="alt text"></li><li>In Sv39 RISC-V, the top 25 bits of a virtual address are not used for translation. The physical<br>address also has room for growth: there is room in the PTE format for the physical page number<br>to grow by another 10 bits. The designers of RISC-V chose these numbers based on technology<br>predictions. 239 bytes is 512 GB, which should be enough address space for applications running on RISC-V computers. 256 is enough physical memory space for the near future to fit many I&#x2F;O<br>devices and RAM chips. If more is needed, the RISC-V designers have defined Sv48 with 48-bit<br>virtual addresses [3].</li><li>As Figure 3.2 shows, a RISC-V CPU translates a virtual address into a physical in three steps.<br>A page table is stored in physical memory as a three-level tree. The root of the tree is a 4096-byte<br>page-table page that contains 512 PTEs, which contain the physical addresses for page-table pages<br>in the next level of the tree. Each of those pages contains 512 PTEs for the final level in the tree.<br>The paging hardware uses the top 9 bits of the 27 bits to select a PTE in the root page-table page,<br>the middle 9 bits to select a PTE in a page-table page in the next level of the tree, and the bottom<br>9 bits to select the final PTE. (In Sv48 RISC-V a page table has four levels, and bits 39 through 47<br>of a virtual address index into the top-level.)<br>If any of the three PTEs required to translate an address is not present, the paging hardware<br>raises a page-fault exception, leaving it up to the kernel to handle the exception (see Chapter 4).<br>The three-level structure of Figure 3.2 allows a memory-efficient way of recording PTEs, com-<br>pared to the single-level design of Figure 3.1. In the common case in which large ranges of virtual<br>addresses have no mappings, the three-level structure can omit entire page directories. For exam-<br>ple, if an application uses only a few pages starting at address zero, then the entries 1 through 511<br>of the top-level page directory are invalid, and the kernel doesn’t have to allocate pages those for<br>511 intermediate page directories. Furthermore, the kernel also doesn’t have to allocate pages for<br>the bottom-level page directories for those 511 intermediate page directories. So, in this example,<br>the three-level design saves 511 pages for intermediate page directories and 511 × 512 pages for<br>bottom-level page directories.<br>Although a CPU walks the three-level structure in hardware as part of executing a load or store<br>instruction, a potential downside of three levels is that the CPU must load three PTEs from memory<br>to perform the translation of the virtual address in the load&#x2F;store instruction to a physical address.<br>To avoid the cost of loading PTEs from physical memory, a RISC-V CPU caches page table entries<br>in a Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB).<br><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch3/image-1.png" alt="alt text"><br>allowed to be used. PTE_V indicates whether the PTE is present: if it is not set, a reference to the<br>page causes an exception (i.e., is not allowed). PTE_R controls whether instructions are allowed<br>to read to the page. PTE_W controls whether instructions are allowed to write to the page. PTE_X<br>controls whether the CPU may interpret the content of the page as instructions and execute them.<br>PTE_U controls whether instructions in user mode are allowed to access the page; if PTE_U is not<br>set, the PTE can be used only in supervisor mode. Figure 3.2 shows how it all works. The flags and<br>all other page hardware-related structures are defined in (kernel&#x2F;riscv.h)</li><li>To tell a CPU to use a page table, the kernel must write the physical address of the root page-<br>table page into the satp register. A CPU will translate all addresses generated by subsequent<br>instructions using the page table pointed to by its own satp. Each CPU has its own satp so that<br>different CPUs can run different processes, each with a private address space described by its own<br>page table.</li><li><strong>notice</strong>:A few notes about terms used in this book. Physical memory refers to storage cells in RAM.<br>A byte of physical memory has an address, called a physical address. Instructions that dereference<br>addresses (such as loads, stores, jumps, and function calls) use only virtual addresses, which the<br>paging hardware translates to physical addresses, and then sends to the RAM hardware to read or<br>write storage. An address space is the set of virtual addresses that are valid in a given page table; each xv6 process has a separate user address space, and the xv6 kernel has its own address space as<br>well. User memory refers to a process’s user address space plus the physical memory that the page<br>table allows the process to access. Virtual memory refers to the ideas and techniques associated<br>with managing page tables and using them to achieve goals such as isolation.<br><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch3/image-2.png" alt="alt text"></li></ul><h3 id="3-2-Kernel-address-space"><a href="#3-2-Kernel-address-space" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Kernel address space"></a>3.2 Kernel address space</h3><ul><li>Xv6 maintains one page table per process, describing each process’s user address space, plus a sin-<br>gle page table that describes the kernel’s address space. The kernel configures the layout of its ad-<br>dress space to give itself access to physical memory and various hardware resources at predictable virtual addresses. Figure 3.3 shows how this layout maps kernel virtual addresses to physical addresses. The file (kernel&#x2F;memlayout.h) declares the constants for xv6’s kernel memory layout.</li><li>The kernel gets at RAM and memory-mapped device registers using “direct mapping;” that<br>is, mapping the resources at virtual addresses that are equal to the physical address. For example,<br>the kernel itself is located at KERNBASE&#x3D;0x80000000 in both the virtual address space and in<br>physical memory. Direct mapping simplifies kernel code that reads or writes physical memory.</li><li>There are a couple of kernel virtual addresses that aren’t direct-mapped:<ul><li>The trampoline page. It is mapped at the top of the virtual address space; user page tables have this same mapping. Chapter 4 discusses the role of the trampoline page, but we see here an interesting use case of page tables; a physical page (holding the trampoline code) is mapped twice in the virtual address space of the kernel: once at top of the virtual address space and once with a direct mapping.</li><li>The kernel stack pages. Each process has its own kernel stack, which is mapped high so that below it xv6 can leave an unmapped guard page. The guard page’s PTE is invalid (i.e., PTE_V is not set), so that if the kernel overflows a kernel stack, it will likely cause an exception and the kernel will panic. Without a guard page an overflowing stack would overwrite other kernel memory, resulting in incorrect operation. A panic crash is preferable.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="3-3-Code-creating-an-address-space"><a href="#3-3-Code-creating-an-address-space" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Code: creating an address space"></a>3.3 Code: creating an address space</h3><ul><li>Most of the xv6 code for manipulating address spaces and page tables resides in vm.c (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:1). The central data structure is pagetable_t, which is really a pointer to a RISC-V root page-table page; a pagetable_t may be either the kernel page table, or one of the per-process page tables. The central functions are walk, which finds the PTE for a virtual address,and mappages, which installs PTEs for new mappings. Functions starting with kvm manipulate the kernel page table; functions starting with uvm manipulate a user page table; other functions are used for both. copyout and copyin copy data to and from user virtual addresses provided as system call arguments; they are in vm.c because they need to explicitly translate those addresses in order to find the corresponding physical memory.</li><li>Early in the boot sequence, main calls kvminit (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:54) to create the kernel’s page ta-<br>ble using kvmmake (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:20). This call occurs before xv6 has enabled paging on the RISC-V,<br>so addresses refer directly to physical memory. kvmmake first allocates a page of physical mem-<br>ory to hold the root page-table page. Then it calls kvmmap to install the translations that the kernel<br>needs. The translations include the kernel’s instructions and data, physical memory up to PHYSTOP,<br>and memory ranges which are actually devices. proc_mapstacks (kernel&#x2F;proc.c:33) allocates a<br>kernel stack for each process. It calls kvmmap to map each stack at the virtual address generated<br>by KSTACK, which leaves room for the invalid stack-guard pages.</li><li><code>kvmmap</code> (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:132) calls mappages (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:144), which installs mappings into a<br>page table for a range of virtual addresses to a corresponding range of physical addresses. It does<br>this separately for each virtual address in the range, at page intervals. For each virtual address to<br>be mapped, mappages calls walk to find the address of the PTE for that address. It then initializes<br>the PTE to hold the relevant physical page number, the desired permissions (PTE_W, PTE_X, and&#x2F;or<br>PTE_R), and PTE_V to mark the PTE as valid (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:165).</li><li><code>walk</code> (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:86) mimics the RISC-V paging hardware as it looks up the PTE for a virtual<br>address (see Figure 3.2). walk descends the page table one level at a time, using each level’s 9<br>bits of virtual address to index into the relevant page directory page. At each level it finds either<br>the PTE of the next level’s page directory page, or the PTE of final page (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:92). If a PTE<br>in a first or second level page directory page isn’t valid, then the required directory page hasn’t<br>yet been allocated; if the alloc argument is set, walk allocates a new page-table page and puts<br>its physical address in the PTE. It returns the address of the PTE in the lowest layer in the tree<br>(kernel&#x2F;vm.c:102).</li><li>main calls kvminithart (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:62) to install the kernel page table. It writes the physical<br>address of the root page-table page into the register satp. After this the CPU will translate ad-<br>dresses using the kernel page table. Since the kernel uses a direct mapping, the now virtual address<br>of the next instruction will map to the right physical memory address.</li><li>Each RISC-V CPU caches page table entries in a Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB), and<br>when xv6 changes a page table, it must tell the CPU to invalidate corresponding cached TLB<br>entries. If it didn’t, then at some point later the TLB might use an old cached mapping, point-<br>ing to a physical page that in the meantime has been allocated to another process, and as a re-<br>sult, a process might be able to scribble on some other process’s memory. The RISC-V has an instruction sfence.vma that flushes the current CPU’s TLB. Xv6 executes sfence.vma in<br>kvminithart after reloading the satp register, and in the trampoline code that switches to a<br>user page table before returning to user space (kernel&#x2F;trampoline.S:89).<br>It is also necessary to issue sfence.vma before changing satp, in order to wait for comple-<br>tion of all outstanding loads and stores. This wait ensures that preceding updates to the page table<br>have completed, and ensures that preceding loads and stores use the old page table, not the new<br>one.<br>To avoid flushing the complete TLB, RISC-V CPUs may support address space identifiers<br>(ASIDs) [3]. The kernel can then flush just the TLB entries for a particular address space. Xv6<br>does not use this feature.</li></ul><h3 id="3-4-Physical-memory-allocation"><a href="#3-4-Physical-memory-allocation" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Physical memory allocation"></a>3.4 Physical memory allocation</h3><ul><li>The kernel must allocate and free physical memory at run-time for page tables, user memory,<br>kernel stacks, and pipe buffers.</li><li>Xv6 uses the physical memory between the end of the kernel and PHYSTOP for run-time alloca-<br>tion. It allocates and frees whole 4096-byte pages at a time. It keeps track of which pages are free<br>by threading a linked list through the pages themselves. Allocation consists of removing a page<br>from the linked list; freeing consists of adding the freed page to the list.</li></ul><h3 id="3-5-Code-Physical-memory-allocator"><a href="#3-5-Code-Physical-memory-allocator" class="headerlink" title="3.5 Code: Physical memory allocator"></a>3.5 Code: Physical memory allocator</h3><ul><li>The allocator resides in kalloc.c (kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:1). The allocator’s data structure is a free list<br>of physical memory pages that are available for allocation. Each free page’s list element is a<br>struct run (kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:17). Where does the allocator get the memory to hold that data struc-<br>ture? It store each free page’s run structure in the free page itself, since there’s nothing else stored<br>there. The free list is protected by a spin lock (kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:21-24). The list and the lock are<br>wrapped in a struct to make clear that the lock protects the fields in the struct. For now, ignore the<br>lock and the calls to acquire and release; Chapter 6 will examine locking in detail.<br>The function main calls kinit to initialize the allocator (kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:27). kinit initializes<br>the free list to hold every page between the end of the kernel and PHYSTOP. Xv6 ought to de-<br>termine how much physical memory is available by parsing configuration information provided<br>by the hardware. Instead xv6 assumes that the machine has 128 megabytes of RAM. kinit calls<br>freerange to add memory to the free list via per-page calls to kfree. A PTE can only refer to<br>a physical address that is aligned on a 4096-byte boundary (is a multiple of 4096), so freerange<br>uses PGROUNDUP to ensure that it frees only aligned physical addresses. The allocator starts with<br>no memory; these calls to kfree give it some to manage.<br>The allocator sometimes treats addresses as integers in order to perform arithmetic on them<br>(e.g., traversing all pages in freerange), and sometimes uses addresses as pointers to read and<br>write memory (e.g., manipulating the run structure stored in each page); this dual use of addresses<br>is the main reason that the allocator code is full of C type casts.<br>The function kfree (kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:47) begins by setting every byte in the memory being freed<br>to the value 1. This will cause code that uses memory after freeing it (uses “dangling references”)<br>to read garbage instead of the old valid contents; hopefully that will cause such code to break faster.<br>Then kfree prepends the page to the free list: it casts pa to a pointer to struct run, records the<br>old start of the free list in r-&gt;next, and sets the free list equal to r. kalloc removes and returns<br>the first element in the free list.</li></ul><h3 id="3-6-Process-address-space"><a href="#3-6-Process-address-space" class="headerlink" title="3.6 Process address space"></a>3.6 Process address space</h3><p><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch3/image-3.png" alt="alt text"></p><ul><li>Each process has its own page table, and when xv6 switches between processes, it also changes<br>page tables. Figure 3.4 shows a process’s address space in more detail than Figure 2.3. A process’s<br>user memory starts at virtual address zero and can grow up to MAXVA (kernel&#x2F;riscv.h:375), allowing<br>a process to address in principle 256 Gigabytes of memory.<br>A process’s address space consists of pages that contain the text of the program (which xv6<br>maps with the permissions PTE_R, PTE_X, and PTE_U), pages that contain the pre-initialized data<br>of the program, a page for the stack, and pages for the heap. Xv6 maps the data, stack, and heap<br>with the permissions PTE_R, PTE_W, and PTE_U.<br>Using permissions within a user address space is a common technique to harden a user process.<br>If the text were mapped with PTE_W, then a process could accidentally modify its own program;<br>for example, a programming error may cause the program to write to a null pointer, modifying<br>instructions at address 0, and then continue running, perhaps creating more havoc. To detect such<br>errors immediately, xv6 maps the text without PTE_W; if a program accidentally attempts to store<br>to address 0, the hardware will refuse to execute the store and raises a page fault (see Section 4.6).<br>The kernel then kills the process and prints out an informative message so that the developer can<br>track down the problem.<br>Similarly, by mapping data without PTE_X, a user program cannot accidentally jump to an<br>address in the program’s data and start executing at that address.<br>In the real world, hardening a process by setting permissions carefully also aids in defending<br>against security attacks. An adversary may feed carefully-constructed input to a program (e.g., a<br>Web server) that triggers a bug in the program in the hope of turning that bug into an exploit [14].<br>Setting permissions carefully and other techniques, such as randomizing of the layout of the user<br>address space, make such attacks harder.<br>The stack is a single page, and is shown with the initial contents as created by exec. Strings<br>containing the command-line arguments, as well as an array of pointers to them, are at the very<br>top of the stack. Just under that are values that allow a program to start at main as if the function<br>main(argc, argv) had just been called.<br>To detect a user stack overflowing the allocated stack memory, xv6 places an inaccessible guard<br>page right below the stack by clearing the PTE_U flag. If the user stack overflows and the process<br>tries to use an address below the stack, the hardware will generate a page-fault exception because<br>the guard page is inaccessible to a program running in user mode. A real-world operating system<br>might instead automatically allocate more memory for the user stack when it overflows.<br>When a process asks xv6 for more user memory, xv6 grows the process’s heap. Xv6 first uses kalloc to allocate physical pages. It then adds PTEs to the process’s page table that point to the<br>new physical pages. Xv6 sets the PTE_W, PTE_R, PTE_U, and PTE_V flags in these PTEs. Most<br>processes do not use the entire user address space; xv6 leaves PTE_V clear in unused PTEs.<br>We see here a few nice examples of use of page tables. First, different processes’ page tables<br>translate user addresses to different pages of physical memory, so that each process has private user<br>memory. Second, each process sees its memory as having contiguous virtual addresses starting at<br>zero, while the process’s physical memory can be non-contiguous. Third, the kernel maps a page<br>with trampoline code at the top of the user address space (without PTE_U), thus a single page of<br>physical memory shows up in all address spaces, but can be used only by the kernel.<br>3.4<br>物理内存分配<br>内核必须在运行时为页表、用户内存、内核栈和管道缓冲区分配和释放物理内存。<br>Xv6 使用内核结束位置到 PHYSTOP 之间的物理内存进行运行时分配。它一次分配和释放整个 4096 字节大小的页。它通过在页自身中穿插一个链表来跟踪哪些页是空闲的。分配操作包括从链表中移除一个页；释放操作则包括将释放的页添加到链表中。</li></ul><p>3.5<br>代码：物理内存分配器<br>分配器位于 kalloc.c（kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:1）文件中。分配器的数据结构是一个空闲页链表，这些页可用于分配。每个空闲页的链表元素是一个 struct run 结构体（kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:17）。分配器从哪里获取内存来存储这个数据结构呢？它会在空闲页本身中存储每个空闲页的 run 结构体，因为那里没有存储其他内容。空闲链表由一个自旋锁保护（kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:21-24）。链表和锁被封装在一个 struct 结构体中，以明确表明该锁保护的是该结构体中的字段。目前，先忽略锁以及 acquire 和 release 的调用；第 6 章将详细探讨锁的使用。<br>main 函数调用 kinit 来初始化分配器（kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:27）。kinit 将空闲链表初始化为包含内核结束位置到 PHYSTOP 之间的所有页。Xv6 本应通过解析硬件提供的配置信息来确定有多少物理内存可用。但相反，Xv6 假设机器有 128 兆字节的 RAM。kinit 调用 freerange，通过逐页调用 kfree 将内存添加到空闲链表中。页表项（PTE）只能引用对齐在 4096 字节边界（即 4096 的倍数）上的物理地址，因此 freerange 使用 PGROUNDUP 来确保只释放对齐的物理地址。分配器开始时没有内存；这些对 kfree 的调用给了它一些内存来管理。<br>分配器有时将地址视为整数以便对它们进行算术运算（例如，遍历 freerange 中的所有页），有时又使用地址作为指针来读写内存（例如，操作存储在每个页中的 run 结构体）；地址的这种双重用途是分配器代码中充满 C 类型转换的主要原因。kfree 函数（kernel&#x2F;kalloc.c:47）首先将正在释放的内存中的每个字节设置为值 1。这将导致在释放内存后使用该内存（使用“悬空引用”）的代码读取到垃圾数据而非旧的有效内容；希望这样能让这类代码更快崩溃。然后 kfree 将页添加到空闲链表的头部：它将物理地址 pa 转换为指向 struct run 的指针，记录空闲链表旧的起始位置到 r-&gt;next 中，并将空闲链表设置为 r。kalloc 移除并返回空闲链表中的第一个元素。</p><p>3.6<br>进程地址空间<br>每个进程都有自己的页表，当 Xv6 在进程之间切换时，它也会切换页表。图 3.4 比图 2.3 更详细地展示了一个进程的地址空间。进程的用户内存从虚拟地址零开始，可以增长到 MAXVA（kernel&#x2F;riscv.h:375），允许一个进程原则上访问 256 吉字节的内存。<br>进程的地址空间由包含程序文本的页（Xv6 使用 PTE_R、PTE_X 和 PTE_U 权限映射）、包含程序预初始化数据的页、一个栈页和堆页组成。Xv6 使用 PTE_R、PTE_W 和 PTE_U 权限映射数据、栈和堆。<br>在用户地址空间中使用权限是一种强化用户进程的常用技术。如果文本使用 PTE_W 权限映射，那么进程可能会意外地修改自己的程序；例如，编程错误可能导致程序向空指针写入，修改地址 0 处的指令，然后继续运行，可能造成更大的破坏。为了立即检测到这类错误，Xv6 不使用 PTE_W 权限映射文本；如果程序意外地尝试向地址 0 存储数据，硬件将拒绝执行存储操作并引发页错误（参见第 4.6 节）。然后内核会终止该进程并打印出有用的信息，以便开发者追踪问题。<br>类似地，通过不使用 PTE_X 权限映射数据，用户程序不能意外地跳转到程序数据中的某个地址并从该地址开始执行。<br>在现实世界中，通过仔细设置权限来强化进程也有助于抵御安全攻击。攻击者可能会向程序（例如，Web 服务器）提供精心构造的输入，以触发程序中的漏洞，希望将该漏洞转化为利用手段[14]。仔细设置权限以及其他技术，例如随机化用户地址空间的布局，会使这类攻击更加困难。<br>栈是一个单独的页，并显示为 exec 创建时的初始内容。包含命令行参数的字符串以及指向它们的指针数组位于栈的最顶部。紧接着下面是允许程序从 main 函数开始执行的值，就好像 main(argc, argv) 函数刚刚被调用一样。<br>为了检测用户栈溢出分配的栈内存，Xv6 在栈的正下方放置了一个不可访问的保护页，方法是清除 PTE_U 标志。如果用户栈溢出且进程尝试使用栈下方的地址，硬件将生成页错误异常，因为保护页对在用户模式下运行的程序是不可访问的。现实世界的操作系统可能会在栈溢出时自动为用户栈分配更多内存。<br>当进程向 Xv6 请求更多用户内存时，Xv6 会扩展进程的堆。Xv6 首先使用 kalloc 分配物理页。然后，它向进程的页表中添加指向新物理页的页表项（PTE）。Xv6 在这些 PTE 中设置 PTE_W、PTE_R、PTE_U 和 PTE_V 标志。大多数进程不会使用整个用户地址空间；Xv6 在未使用的 PTE 中保持 PTE_V 标志为清除状态。<br>我们在这里看到了几个使用页表的好例子。首先，不同进程的页表将用户地址转换为不同物理内存页，因此每个进程都有私有的用户内存。其次，每个进程都看到自己的内存从零开始具有连续的虚拟地址，而进程的物理内存可以是不连续的。第三，内核在用户地址空间的顶部映射了一个包含蹦床代码的页（没有 PTE_U 权限），因此一页物理内存出现在所有地址空间中，但只能由内核使用。</p><h3 id="3-7-Code-sbrk"><a href="#3-7-Code-sbrk" class="headerlink" title="3.7 Code: sbrk"></a>3.7 Code: sbrk</h3><ul><li>sbrk is the system call for a process to shrink or grow its memory. The system call is implemented<br>by the function growproc (kernel&#x2F;proc.c:260). growproc calls uvmalloc or uvmdealloc, de-<br>pending on whether n is positive or negative. uvmalloc (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:233) allocates physical mem-<br>ory with kalloc, zeros the allocated memory, and adds PTEs to the user page table with mappages.<br>uvmdealloc calls uvmunmap (kernel&#x2F;vm.c:178), which uses walk to find PTEs and kfree to<br>free the physical memory they refer to.<br>Xv6 uses a process’s page table not just to tell the hardware how to map user virtual addresses, but also as the only record of which physical memory pages are allocated to that process. That is the reason why freeing user memory (in uvmunmap) requires examination of the user page table.</li></ul><h3 id="3-8-Code-exec"><a href="#3-8-Code-exec" class="headerlink" title="3.8 Code: exec"></a>3.8 Code: exec</h3><ul><li>A binary is typically the output of the compiler and linker, and holds<br>machine instructions and program data. <code>exec</code> (kernel&#x2F;exec.c:23) opens the named binary path using<br>namei (kernel&#x2F;exec.c:36), which is explained in Chapter 8. Then, it reads the ELF header. Xv6<br>binaries are formatted in the widely-used ELF format, defined in (kernel&#x2F;elf.h). An ELF binary<br>consists of an ELF header, struct elfhdr (kernel&#x2F;elf.h:6), followed by a sequence of program<br>section headers, struct proghdr (kernel&#x2F;elf.h:25). Each progvhdr describes a section of the<br>application that must be loaded into memory; xv6 programs have two program section headers:<br>one for instructions and one for data.<br>The first step is a quick check that the file probably contains an ELF binary. An ELF binary<br>starts with the four-byte “magic number” 0x7F, ‘E’, ‘L’, ‘F’, or ELF_MAGIC (kernel&#x2F;elf.h:3). If<br>the ELF header has the right magic number, exec assumes that the binary is well-formed.<br>exec allocates a new page table with no user mappings with proc_pagetable (kernel&#x2F;exec.c:49),<br>allocates memory for each ELF segment with uvmalloc (kernel&#x2F;exec.c:65), and loads each segment<br>into memory with loadseg (kernel&#x2F;exec.c:10). loadseg uses walkaddr to find the physical ad-<br>dress of the allocated memory at which to write each page of the ELF segment, and readi to read<br>from the file.</li><li>The program section header for

RISC-V is a 64-bit CPU, and xv6<br>is written in “LP64” C, which means long (L) and pointers (P) in the C programming language<br>are 64 bits, but an int is 32 bits.</li><li><a href="https://lf-riscv.atlassian.net/wiki/x/kYD2">RISCV Technical Specifications</a></li></ul><h3 id="2-1-Abstracting-physical-resources"><a href="#2-1-Abstracting-physical-resources" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Abstracting physical resources"></a>2.1 Abstracting physical resources</h3><ul><li>The Unix interface is not the only way to abstract<br>resources, but it has proved to be a good one.</li></ul><h3 id="2-2-User-mode-supervisor-mode-and-system-calls"><a href="#2-2-User-mode-supervisor-mode-and-system-calls" class="headerlink" title="2.2 User mode, supervisor mode, and system calls"></a>2.2 User mode, supervisor mode, and system calls</h3><ul><li>CPUs provide hardware support for strong isolation. For example, RISC-V has three modes in<br>which the CPU can execute instructions: machine mode, supervisor mode, and user mode. Instruc-<br>tions executing in machine mode have full privilege; a CPU starts in machine mode. Machine mode<br>is mostly intended for setting up the computer during boot. Xv6 executes a few lines in machine<br>mode and then changes to supervisor mode.</li><li>In supervisor mode the CPU is allowed to execute privileged instructions: for example, en-<br>abling and disabling interrupts, reading and writing the register that holds the address of a page<br>table, etc.</li><li>An application can execute only user-mode instructions (e.g., adding<br>numbers, etc.) and is said to be running in user space, while the software in supervisor mode can<br>also execute privileged instructions and is said to be running in kernel space. The software running<br>in kernel space (or in supervisor mode) is called the kernel.</li><li>CPUs provide a<br>special instruction that switches the CPU from user mode to supervisor mode and enters the kernel<br>at an entry point specified by the kernel. (RISC-V provides the ecall instruction for this purpose.)<br>Once the CPU has switched to supervisor mode, the kernel can then validate the arguments of the<br>system call (e.g., check if the address passed to the system call is part of the application’s memory),<br>decide whether the application is allowed to perform the requested operation (e.g., check if the<br>application is allowed to write the specified file), and then deny it or execute it. It is important that<br>the kernel control the entry point for transitions to supervisor mode; if the application could decide<br>the kernel entry point, a malicious application could, for example, enter the kernel at a point where<br>the validation of arguments is skipped.</li></ul><h3 id="2-3-Kernel-organization"><a href="#2-3-Kernel-organization" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Kernel organization"></a>2.3 Kernel organization</h3><ul><li>A key design question is what part of the operating system should run in supervisor mode. One<br>possibility is that the entire operating system resides in the kernel, so that the implementations of<br>all system calls run in supervisor mode. This organization is called a <strong>monolithic kernel</strong>.</li><li>A downside of the monolithic organization is that the interactions among different parts of<br>the operating system are often complex (as we will see in the rest of this text), and therefore it is easy for an operating system developer to make a mistake. In a monolithic kernel, a mistake is<br>fatal, because an error in supervisor mode will often cause the kernel to fail. If the kernel fails,<br>the computer stops working, and thus all applications fail too. The computer must reboot to start<br>again.</li><li>To reduce the risk of mistakes in the kernel, OS designers can minimize the amount of operating<br>system code that runs in supervisor mode, and execute the bulk of the operating system in user<br>mode. This kernel organization is called a <strong>microkernel</strong>.</li><li>Figure 2.1 illustrates this microkernel design. In the figure, the file system runs as a user-level<br>process. OS services running as processes are called servers. To allow applications to interact with<br>the file server, the kernel provides an <strong>inter-process communication mechanism</strong> to send messages<br>from one user-mode process to another.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch2/image.png" alt="alt text"></li><li>Xv6 is implemented as a monolithic kernel, like most Unix operating systems. Thus, the xv6<br>kernel interface corresponds to the operating system interface, and the kernel implements the com-<br>plete operating system. Since xv6 doesn’t provide many services, its kernel is smaller than some<br>microkernels, but conceptually xv6 is monolithic.</li></ul><h3 id="2-4-Code-xv6-organization"><a href="#2-4-Code-xv6-organization" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Code: xv6 organization"></a>2.4 Code: xv6 organization</h3><ul><li><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch2/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></li><li>The xv6 kernel source is in the kernel&#x2F; sub-directory. The source is divided into files, following<br>a rough notion of modularity; Figure 2.2 lists the files.The inter-module interfaces are defined in defs.h (kernel&#x2F;defs.h).</li></ul><h3 id="2-5-Process-overview"><a href="#2-5-Process-overview" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Process overview"></a>2.5 Process overview</h3><ul><li>The unit of isolation in xv6 (as in other Unix operating systems) is a process. The process ab-<br>straction prevents one process from wrecking or spying on another process’s memory, CPU, file<br>descriptors, etc. It also prevents a process from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process can’t<br>subvert the kernel’s isolation mechanisms.</li><li>To help enforce isolation, the process abstraction provides the illusion to a program that it has<br>its own private machine. A process provides a program with what appears to be a private memory<br>system, or address space, which other processes cannot read or write. A process also provides the<br>program with what appears to be its own CPU to execute the program’s instructions.</li><li>Xv6 uses page tables (which are implemented by hardware) to give each process its own ad-<br>dress space. The RISC-V page table translates (or “maps”) a virtual address (the address that an<br>RISC-V instruction manipulates) to a physical address (an address that the CPU sends to main<br>memory).</li></ul><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs plaintext">|  9 bits | 9 bits | 9 bits |     12 bits     |<br>|  VPN[2] | VPN[1] | VPN[0] | Page Offset     |<br>|--------  页表索引 --------| 页内偏移 |<br><br>example:<br>虚拟地址：0x0000004001234567<br>              ↓<br>VPN[2] = 0x01  → level-2 页表（根）中偏移 8，得到 PTE1 → 指向 0x2000_0000<br>VPN[1] = 0x01  → level-1 页表中偏移 8，得到 PTE2 → 指向 0x3000_0000<br>VPN[0] = 0x46  → level-0 页表中偏移 0x230，得到 PTE3 → 页帧 0x4000<br>offset  = 0x4567<br><br>→ 最终物理地址 = 0x4000_0000 + 0x4567 = **0x4000_4567**<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ul><li>Xv6 maintains a separate page table for each process that defines that process’s address space.<br>As illustrated in Figure 2.3, an address space includes the process’s user memory starting at virtual<br>address zero.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch2/image-2.png" alt="alt text"><ul><li>Instructions come first, followed by global variables, then the stack, and finally a “heap” area (for malloc) that the process can expand as needed.</li><li>There are a number of factors that limit the maximum size of a  process’s address space: pointers on the RISC-V are 64 bits wide; the hardware uses only the low 39 bits when looking up virtual addresses in page tables; and xv6 uses only 38 of those 39 bits. Thus, the maximum address is 238 − 1 &#x3D; 0x3fffffffff, which is MAXVA (kernel&#x2F;riscv.h:378).</li><li>At the top of the address space xv6 places a trampoline page (4096 bytes) and a trapframe page. Xv6 uses these two pages to transition into the kernel and back; the trampoline page contains the code to transition in and out of the kernel, and the trapframe is where the kernel saves the process’s user registers, as Chapter 4 explains.</li></ul></li><li>The xv6 kernel maintains many pieces of state for each process, which it gathers into a struct proc (kernel&#x2F;proc.h:85). A process’s most important pieces of kernel state are its page table, its kernel<br>stack, and its run state. We’ll use the notation p-&gt;xxx to refer to elements of the proc structure; for example, p-&gt;pagetable is a pointer to the process’s page table.</li><li>Each process has a thread of control (or thread for short) that holds the state needed to ex-<br>ecute the process.might be executing on a CPU, or suspended (not<br>executing, but capable of resuming executing in the future).</li><li>Each process has two stacks:<ul><li><strong>user stack</strong>: When the process is executing user instructions,only its user stack is in use, and its kernel stack is empty.</li><li><strong>kernel stack</strong>: When the process enters the kernel (for a system call or interrupt), the kernel code executes on the process’s kernel stack;   while a process is in the kernel, its user stack still contains saved data, but isn’t actively used.</li><li>A process’s thread alternates between actively using its user stack and its kernel stack.   The kernel stack is separate (and protected from user code) so that the kernel can execute even if a process has wrecked its user stack.</li></ul></li><li>A process can make a system call by executing the RISC-V <code>ecall</code> instruction. This instruction raises the hardware privilege level and changes the program counter to a kernel-defined entry point. The code at the entry point switches to the process’s kernel stack and executes the kernel instructions that implement the system call. When the system call completes, the kernel switches back to the user stack and returns to user space by calling the <code>sret</code> instruction, which lowers the hardware privilege level and resumes executing user instructions just after the system call instruction. A process’s thread can “block” in the kernel to wait for I&#x2F;O, and resume where it left off when the I&#x2F;O has finished.</li><li><code>p-&gt;state</code> indicates whether the process is allocated, ready to run, currently running on a CPU, waiting for I&#x2F;O, or exiting.</li><li><code>p-&gt;pagetable</code> holds the process’s page table, in the format that the RISC-V hardware ex- pects. Xv6 causes the paging hardware to use a process’s p-&gt;pagetable when executing that process in user space.

Then it starts a shell on the console. The system is up.</p><h3 id="2-7-Security-Model"><a href="#2-7-Security-Model" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Security Model"></a>2.7 Security Model</h3><ul><li><p>The operating system must assume that a process’s <strong>user-level code</strong> will do its best to wreck the kernel or other processes.User code may try to dereference pointers outside its allowed address space; it may attempt to execute any RISC-V instructions, even those not intended for user code; it may try to read and write any RISC-V control register; it may try to directly access device hardware; and it may pass clever values to system calls in an attempt to trick the kernel into crashing or doing something stupid. The kernel’s goal is to restrict each user process so that all it can do is:</p><ul><li>read&#x2F;write&#x2F;execute its own user memory,</li><li>use the 32 general-purpose RISC-V registers,</li><li>and affect the kernel and other processes <strong>only</strong> in the ways that system calls are intended to allow.</li></ul></li><li><p>The expectations for the <strong>kernel’s own code</strong> are quite different.Kernel code is assumed to be written by well-meaning and careful programmers.Kernel code is expected to be bug-free, and certainly to contain nothing malicious.This assumption affects how we analyze kernel code.For example, there are many internal kernel functions (e.g., the spin locks) that would cause serious problems if kernel code used them incorrectly.When examining any specific piece of kernel code, we’ll want to convince ourselves that it behaves correctly.We assume, however, that kernel code in general is correctly written, and follows all the rules about use of the kernel’s own functions and data structures. At the hardware level, the RISC-V CPU, RAM, disk, etc. are assumed to operate as advertised in the documentation, with no hardware bugs.</p></li></ul><h3 id="2-8-Real-world"><a href="#2-8-Real-world" class="headerlink" title="2.8 Real world"></a>2.8 Real world</h3><p>Most operating systems have adopted the process concept, and most processes look similar to xv6’s. Modern operating systems, however, support several threads within a process, to allow a single process to exploit multiple CPUs. Supporting multiple threads in a process involves quite a bit of machinery that xv6 doesn’t have, often including interface changes (e.g., Linux’s clone, a variant of fork), to control which aspects of a process threads share.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Each running program, called a process, has memory containing<br>instructions, data, and a stack. The instructions implement the program’s computation. The data<br>are the variables on which the computation acts. The stack organizes the program’s procedure calls.<br>A given computer typically has many processes but only a single kernel.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image.png" alt="alt text"></p></li><li><p>When a user program invokes a sys-<br>tem call, the hardware raises the privilege level and starts executing a pre-arranged function in the<br>kernel.<br>The collection of system calls that a kernel provides is the interface that user programs see. The<br>xv6 kernel provides a subset of the services and system calls that Unix kernels traditionally offer.<br>Figure 1.2 lists all of xv6’s system calls.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></p></li><li><p>The shell is an ordinary program that reads commands from the user and executes them. The<br>fact that the shell is a user program, and not part of the kernel, illustrates the power of the system<br>call interface: there is nothing special about the shell. It also means that the shell is easy to replace;<br>as a result, modern Unix systems have a variety of shells to choose from, each with its own user<br>interface and scripting features. The xv6 shell is a simple implementation of the essence of the<br>Unix Bourne shell. Its implementation can be found at (user&#x2F;sh.c:1).<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image-2.png" alt="alt text"><br>The xv6 shell uses the exec calls of blew to run programs on behalf of users. The main structure of<br>the shell is simple; see main (user&#x2F;sh.c:146). The main loop reads a line of input from the user with<br>getcmd. Then it calls fork, which creates a copy of the shell process. The parent calls wait,<br>while the child runs the command. For example, if the user had typed “echo hello” to the shell,<br>runcmd would have been called with “echo hello” as the argument. runcmd (user&#x2F;sh.c:55) runs<br>the actual command. For “echo hello”, it would call exec (user&#x2F;sh.c:79). If exec succeeds then<br>the child will execute instructions from echo instead of runcmd. At some point echo will call<br>exit, which will cause the parent to return from wait in main (user&#x2F;sh.c:146).</p></li></ul><h3 id="1-1-Processes-and-memory"><a href="#1-1-Processes-and-memory" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Processes and memory"></a>1.1 Processes and memory</h3><ul><li>An xv6 process consists of user-space memory (instructions, data, and stack) and per-process state<br>private to the kernel. Xv6 time-shares processes: it transparently switches the available CPUs<br>among the set of processes waiting to execute. When a process is not executing, xv6 saves the<br>process’s CPU registers, restoring them when it next runs the process. The kernel associates a<br>process identifier, or PID, with each process.</li><li>the following program fragment written in the C programming lan-<br>guage</li></ul><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs c"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> pid = fork();<br><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(pid &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)&#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;parent: child=%d\n&quot;</span>, pid);<br>pid = wait((<span class="hljs-type">int</span> *) <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;child %d is done\n&quot;</span>, pid);<br>&#125; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(pid == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)&#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;child: exiting\n&quot;</span>);<br><span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);<br>&#125; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> &#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;fork error\n&quot;</span>);<br>&#125;<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In the example, the output lines<br>parent: child&#x3D;1234<br>child: exiting<br>might come out in either order (or even intermixed), depending on whether the parent or child gets<br>to its printf call first. After the child exits, the parent’s wait returns, causing the parent to print<br>parent: child 1234 is done<br>Although the child has the same memory contents as the parent initially, the parent and child are<br>executing with separate memory and separate registers: changing a variable in one does not affect<br>the other. For example, when the return value of wait is stored into pid in the parent process, it<br>doesn’t change the variable pid in the child. The value of pid in the child will still be zero.</p><ul><li>The exec system call replaces the calling process’s memory with a new memory image loaded<br>from a file stored in the file system. The file must have a particular format, which specifies which<br>part of the file holds instructions, which part is data, at which instruction to start, etc. Xv6 uses the<br>ELF format, which Chapter 3 discusses in more detail. Usually the file is the result of compiling<br>a program’s source code. When exec succeeds, it does not return to the calling program; instead,<br>the instructions loaded from the file start executing at the entry point declared in the ELF header.<br>exec takes two arguments: the name of the file containing the executable and an array of string<br>arguments.

A process may obtain a file descriptor by opening a file, directory, or device,<br>or by creating a pipe, or by duplicating an existing descriptor. For simplicity we’ll often refer<br>to the object a file descriptor refers to as a “file”; the file descriptor interface abstracts away the<br>differences between files, pipes, and devices, making them all look like streams of bytes. We’ll<br>refer to input and output as I&#x2F;O.</li><li>Internally, the xv6 kernel uses the file descriptor as an index into a per-process table, so that<br>every process has a private space of file descriptors starting at zero. By convention, a process reads<br>from file descriptor 0 (standard input), writes output to file descriptor 1 (standard output), and<br>writes error messages to file descriptor 2 (standard error). As we will see, the shell exploits the<br>convention to implement I&#x2F;O redirection and pipelines. The shell ensures that it always has three<br>file descriptors open (user&#x2F;sh.c:152), which are by default file descriptors for the console.</li><li>The following program fragment (which forms the essence of the program cat) copies data<br>from its standard input to its standard output.

The child process creates a pipe to connect the left end of the<br>pipeline with the right end. Then it calls fork and runcmd for the left end of the pipeline and<br>fork and runcmd for the right end, and waits for both to finish.

Our main goals for xv6 are simplicity and clarity while providing a simple UNIX-like<br>system-call interface. Several people have extended xv6 with a few more system calls and a sim-<br>ple C library in order to run basic Unix programs. Modern kernels, however, provide many more<br>system calls, and many more kinds of kernel services, than xv6. For example, they support net-<br>working, windowing systems, user-level threads, drivers for many devices, and so on. Modern<br>kernels evolve continuously and rapidly, and offer many features beyond POSIX.</li><li>Xv6 does not provide a notion of users or of protecting one user from another; in Unix terms,<br>all xv6 processes run as root.</li></ul><h3 id="comments："><a href="#comments：" class="headerlink" title="comments："></a>comments：</h3><ul><li>Linux tries to adhere to POSIX (glibc provides most of the POSIX interfaces), but has its own extensions (e.g., epoll).</li><li>Programmers who write POSIX interfaces can compile and run them on macOS, BSD, and Linux (as long as they don’t use platform-specific extensions).</li><li>Think of the xv6 system call interface as a “subset implementation of POSIX.”</li><li></li></ul><p><a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/"><strong>POSIX文档</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>
