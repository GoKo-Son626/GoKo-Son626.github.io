RISC-V is a 64-bit CPU, and xv6<br>is written in “LP64” C, which means long (L) and pointers (P) in the C programming language<br>are 64 bits, but an int is 32 bits.</li><li><a href="https://lf-riscv.atlassian.net/wiki/x/kYD2">RISCV Technical Specifications</a></li></ul><h3 id="2-1-Abstracting-physical-resources"><a href="#2-1-Abstracting-physical-resources" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Abstracting physical resources"></a>2.1 Abstracting physical resources</h3><ul><li>The Unix interface is not the only way to abstract<br>resources, but it has proved to be a good one.</li></ul><h3 id="2-2-User-mode-supervisor-mode-and-system-calls"><a href="#2-2-User-mode-supervisor-mode-and-system-calls" class="headerlink" title="2.2 User mode, supervisor mode, and system calls"></a>2.2 User mode, supervisor mode, and system calls</h3><ul><li>CPUs provide hardware support for strong isolation. For example, RISC-V has three modes in<br>which the CPU can execute instructions: machine mode, supervisor mode, and user mode. Instruc-<br>tions executing in machine mode have full privilege; a CPU starts in machine mode. Machine mode<br>is mostly intended for setting up the computer during boot. Xv6 executes a few lines in machine<br>mode and then changes to supervisor mode.</li><li>In supervisor mode the CPU is allowed to execute privileged instructions: for example, en-<br>abling and disabling interrupts, reading and writing the register that holds the address of a page<br>table, etc.</li><li>An application can execute only user-mode instructions (e.g., adding<br>numbers, etc.) and is said to be running in user space, while the software in supervisor mode can<br>also execute privileged instructions and is said to be running in kernel space. The software running<br>in kernel space (or in supervisor mode) is called the kernel.</li><li>CPUs provide a<br>special instruction that switches the CPU from user mode to supervisor mode and enters the kernel<br>at an entry point specified by the kernel. (RISC-V provides the ecall instruction for this purpose.)<br>Once the CPU has switched to supervisor mode, the kernel can then validate the arguments of the<br>system call (e.g., check if the address passed to the system call is part of the application’s memory),<br>decide whether the application is allowed to perform the requested operation (e.g., check if the<br>application is allowed to write the specified file), and then deny it or execute it. It is important that<br>the kernel control the entry point for transitions to supervisor mode; if the application could decide<br>the kernel entry point, a malicious application could, for example, enter the kernel at a point where<br>the validation of arguments is skipped.</li></ul><h3 id="2-3-Kernel-organization"><a href="#2-3-Kernel-organization" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Kernel organization"></a>2.3 Kernel organization</h3><ul><li>A key design question is what part of the operating system should run in supervisor mode. One<br>possibility is that the entire operating system resides in the kernel, so that the implementations of<br>all system calls run in supervisor mode. This organization is called a <strong>monolithic kernel</strong>.</li><li>A downside of the monolithic organization is that the interactions among different parts of<br>the operating system are often complex (as we will see in the rest of this text), and therefore it is easy for an operating system developer to make a mistake. In a monolithic kernel, a mistake is<br>fatal, because an error in supervisor mode will often cause the kernel to fail. If the kernel fails,<br>the computer stops working, and thus all applications fail too. The computer must reboot to start<br>again.</li><li>To reduce the risk of mistakes in the kernel, OS designers can minimize the amount of operating<br>system code that runs in supervisor mode, and execute the bulk of the operating system in user<br>mode. This kernel organization is called a <strong>microkernel</strong>.</li><li>Figure 2.1 illustrates this microkernel design. In the figure, the file system runs as a user-level<br>process. OS services running as processes are called servers. To allow applications to interact with<br>the file server, the kernel provides an <strong>inter-process communication mechanism</strong> to send messages<br>from one user-mode process to another.<br><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch2/image.png" alt="alt text"></li><li>Xv6 is implemented as a monolithic kernel, like most Unix operating systems. Thus, the xv6<br>kernel interface corresponds to the operating system interface, and the kernel implements the com-<br>plete operating system. Since xv6 doesn’t provide many services, its kernel is smaller than some<br>microkernels, but conceptually xv6 is monolithic.</li></ul><h3 id="2-4-Code-xv6-organization"><a href="#2-4-Code-xv6-organization" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Code: xv6 organization"></a>2.4 Code: xv6 organization</h3><p><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch2/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></p><ul><li>The xv6 kernel source is in the kernel&#x2F; sub-directory. The source is divided into files, following<br>a rough notion of modularity; Figure 2.2 lists the files.The inter-module interfaces are defined in defs.h (kernel&#x2F;defs.h).</li></ul><h3 id="2-5-Process-overview"><a href="#2-5-Process-overview" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Process overview"></a>2.5 Process overview</h3><ul><li>The unit of isolation in xv6 (as in other Unix operating systems) is a process. The process ab-<br>straction prevents one process from wrecking or spying on another process’s memory, CPU, file<br>descriptors, etc. It also prevents a process from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process can’t<br>subvert the kernel’s isolation mechanisms.</li><li>To help enforce isolation, the process abstraction provides the illusion to a program that it has<br>its own private machine. A process provides a program with what appears to be a private memory<br>system, or address space, which other processes cannot read or write. A process also provides the<br>program with what appears to be its own CPU to execute the program’s instructions.</li><li>Xv6 uses page tables (which are implemented by hardware) to give each process its own ad-<br>dress space. The RISC-V page table translates (or “maps”) a virtual address (the address that an<br>RISC-V instruction manipulates) to a physical address (an address that the CPU sends to main<br>memory).<br><img src="/post/xv6-riscv-ch2/image-2.png" alt="alt text"></li></ul><h3 id="2-6-Code-starting-xv6-the-first-process-and-system-call"><a href="#2-6-Code-starting-xv6-the-first-process-and-system-call" class="headerlink" title="2.6 Code: starting xv6, the first process and system call"></a>2.6 Code: starting xv6, the first process and system call</h3><h3 id="2-7-Security-Model"><a href="#2-7-Security-Model" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Security Model"></a>2.7 Security Model</h3><h3 id="2-8-Real-world"><a href="#2-8-Real-world" class="headerlink" title="2.8 Real world"></a>2.8 Real world</h3>]]></content:encoded>

Each running program, called a process, has memory containing<br>instructions, data, and a stack. The instructions implement the program’s computation. The data<br>are the variables on which the computation acts. The stack organizes the program’s procedure calls.<br>A given computer typically has many processes but only a single kernel.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image.png" alt="alt text"></p></li><li><p>When a user program invokes a sys-<br>tem call, the hardware raises the privilege level and starts executing a pre-arranged function in the<br>kernel.<br>The collection of system calls that a kernel provides is the interface that user programs see. The<br>xv6 kernel provides a subset of the services and system calls that Unix kernels traditionally offer.<br>Figure 1.2 lists all of xv6’s system calls.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></p></li><li><p>The shell is an ordinary program that reads commands from the user and executes them. The<br>fact that the shell is a user program, and not part of the kernel, illustrates the power of the system<br>call interface: there is nothing special about the shell. It also means that the shell is easy to replace;<br>as a result, modern Unix systems have a variety of shells to choose from, each with its own user<br>interface and scripting features. The xv6 shell is a simple implementation of the essence of the<br>Unix Bourne shell. Its implementation can be found at (user&#x2F;sh.c:1).<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoKo-Son626/my-blog_images/main/xv6-riscv-ch1/image-2.png" alt="alt text"><br>The xv6 shell uses the exec calls of blew to run programs on behalf of users. The main structure of<br>the shell is simple; see main (user&#x2F;sh.c:146). The main loop reads a line of input from the user with<br>getcmd. Then it calls fork, which creates a copy of the shell process. The parent calls wait,<br>while the child runs the command. For example, if the user had typed “echo hello” to the shell,<br>runcmd would have been called with “echo hello” as the argument. runcmd (user&#x2F;sh.c:55) runs<br>the actual command. For “echo hello”, it would call exec (user&#x2F;sh.c:79). If exec succeeds then<br>the child will execute instructions from echo instead of runcmd. At some point echo will call<br>exit, which will cause the parent to return from wait in main (user&#x2F;sh.c:146).</p></li></ul><h3 id="1-1-Processes-and-memory"><a href="#1-1-Processes-and-memory" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Processes and memory"></a>1.1 Processes and memory</h3><ul><li>An xv6 process consists of user-space memory (instructions, data, and stack) and per-process state<br>private to the kernel. Xv6 time-shares processes: it transparently switches the available CPUs<br>among the set of processes waiting to execute. When a process is not executing, xv6 saves the<br>process’s CPU registers, restoring them when it next runs the process. The kernel associates a<br>process identifier, or PID, with each process.</li><li>the following program fragment written in the C programming lan-<br>guage</li></ul><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs c"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> pid = fork();<br><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(pid &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)&#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;parent: child=%d\n&quot;</span>, pid);<br>pid = wait((<span class="hljs-type">int</span> *) <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;child %d is done\n&quot;</span>, pid);<br>&#125; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(pid == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)&#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;child: exiting\n&quot;</span>);<br><span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);<br>&#125; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> &#123;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;fork error\n&quot;</span>);<br>&#125;<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In the example, the output lines<br>parent: child&#x3D;1234<br>child: exiting<br>might come out in either order (or even intermixed), depending on whether the parent or child gets<br>to its printf call first. After the child exits, the parent’s wait returns, causing the parent to print<br>parent: child 1234 is done<br>Although the child has the same memory contents as the parent initially, the parent and child are<br>executing with separate memory and separate registers: changing a variable in one does not affect<br>the other. For example, when the return value of wait is stored into pid in the parent process, it<br>doesn’t change the variable pid in the child. The value of pid in the child will still be zero.</p><ul><li>The exec system call replaces the calling process’s memory with a new memory image loaded<br>from a file stored in the file system. The file must have a particular format, which specifies which<br>part of the file holds instructions, which part is data, at which instruction to start, etc. Xv6 uses the<br>ELF format, which Chapter 3 discusses in more detail. Usually the file is the result of compiling<br>a program’s source code. When exec succeeds, it does not return to the calling program; instead,<br>the instructions loaded from the file start executing at the entry point declared in the ELF header.<br>exec takes two arguments: the name of the file containing the executable and an array of string<br>arguments.

A process that needs more memory at run-time (perhaps for malloc) can call sbrk(n) to<br>grow its data memory by n zero bytes; sbrk returns the location of the new memory.</li></ul><h3 id="1-2-I-O-and-File-descriptors"><a href="#1-2-I-O-and-File-descriptors" class="headerlink" title="1.2 I&#x2F;O and File descriptors"></a>1.2 I&#x2F;O and File descriptors</h3><ul><li>A file descriptor is a small integer representing a kernel-managed object that a process may read<br>from or write to. A process may obtain a file descriptor by opening a file, directory, or device,<br>or by creating a pipe, or by duplicating an existing descriptor. For simplicity we’ll often refer<br>to the object a file descriptor refers to as a “file”; the file descriptor interface abstracts away the<br>differences between files, pipes, and devices, making them all look like streams of bytes. We’ll<br>refer to input and output as I&#x2F;O.</li><li>Internally, the xv6 kernel uses the file descriptor as an index into a per-process table, so that<br>every process has a private space of file descriptors starting at zero. By convention, a process reads<br>from file descriptor 0 (standard input), writes output to file descriptor 1 (standard output), and<br>writes error messages to file descriptor 2 (standard error). As we will see, the shell exploits the<br>convention to implement I&#x2F;O redirection and pipelines. The shell ensures that it always has three<br>file descriptors open (user&#x2F;sh.c:152), which are by default file descriptors for the console.</li><li>The following program fragment (which forms the essence of the program cat) copies data<br>from its standard input to its standard output.

The use of file descriptors and the convention that file descriptor 0 is input and<br>file descriptor 1 is output allows a simple implementation of cat.</p><ul><li>The close system call releases a file descriptor, making it free for reuse by a future open,<br>pipe, or dup system call (see below).

Our main goals for xv6 are simplicity and clarity while providing a simple UNIX-like<br>system-call interface. Several people have extended xv6 with a few more system calls and a sim-<br>ple C library in order to run basic Unix programs. Modern kernels, however, provide many more<br>system calls, and many more kinds of kernel services, than xv6. For example, they support net-<br>working, windowing systems, user-level threads, drivers for many devices, and so on.
